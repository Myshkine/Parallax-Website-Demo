    <h2>Elevate</h2>
    <p>Some describe our product as "being shot into space, with no sense of where  you are or where you are going to". Where? What do we mean by that? It’s fantastically difficult to explain. Here’s the closest approximation in words.
        You enter into a place of endlessly intricate, fractalizing architecture. This place is very convincingly real. There are kaleidoscopic corridors and hallways veering off in every direction that tend to meet at larger rooms or junctions of some kind. To a certain degree, you can travel through this architecture. It’s apparent this Other Space both is and is not in our dimension. It’s more like the crawlspace between dimensions. I know this sounds completely insane, but it’s very convincing. It seems exceedingly real — maybe more real than the normal reality we live in. </p>

    <h2>Be The Traveller</h2>
    <p>Look at yourself in a mirror-if you are in some sort of human form and the looking glass returns any sort of reflection, then, for reasons that will soon be explained, you are an Interdimensional Traveler. If the mirror does not return your reflection, then you are definitely an Interdimensional Traveler and probably know it. You have always been an Interdimensional Traveler.</p>
